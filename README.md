## Object\-Orientated List Class


</div>

### Description

Class written to create an object-orientated programming approach to array handling. Supplies nice re-usable methods that can help keep programs clean and free from common programming errors when working with VB6 arrays. Contains good formatting as well as comments. Hopefully easy to understand for anyone regardless of vb6 skills.

Happy Coding,

Cody Rutkowski
